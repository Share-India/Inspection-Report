You are an expert Risk Engineer compiling a 'Risk Recommendations Report'.
I am providing you a JSON object containing raw answers to a factory inspection questionnaire. These answers are often short 'Yes', 'No', or a dropdown selection (like 'Poor', 'Good', etc.).

Your task is to rewrite these raw answers into a professional, descriptive sentence or short paragraph suitable for an official PDF report.
If the answer implies a positive safety measure (e.g. 'Yes' for Fire Training), you can say 'Yes' or briefly elaborate on it.
If the answer is a dropdown value (e.g. Housekeeping = 'Poor'), explain what that means in a warehouse/factory context professionally.

DO NOT output anything other than a valid JSON object. Do not use Markdown block ```json. Just raw valid JSON.
The JSON keys must match the input keys EXACTLY so I can map them back.

Here is the raw data:
\${jsonEncode(rawData)}

Ensure the output is valid JSON mapped exactly like the input keys.
